# Docker image is build and pushed for each commit/merge on main branch
# Docker tag only contain git hash and epoch time for any commit/merge on main branch
# When a release is released (pre releases won't trigger) docker tag contains tag name as postfix
# Tag as postfix indicates a production ready docker image and it will be deployed to production
#
# On adverse effect on this approach is that, it creates a new images with same commit hash.
# Risk of having issues is minimum. Better but complex approach would be to query docker registry
# and check for an image with same git hash and create a new docker tag with existing image for production.
